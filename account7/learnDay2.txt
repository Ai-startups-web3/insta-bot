Day 2 of Backend Development with Nodejs Journey!

Reflecting on Day 1, it was truly exciting to dive into the foundational concepts of how web applications work behind the scenes. The lesson truly solidified my understanding of the backend's critical role – it's the operational brain, handling data storage, business logic, security, and connecting the frontend to resources.

What particularly struck me was grasping how Node.js, with its JavaScript-based runtime, allows us to build powerful, scalable server-side applications. Leveraging a familiar language for both frontend and backend development feels like a significant advantage, streamlining the process.

It makes me curious – what was your biggest 'aha!' moment when you first started learning backend development, and what drew you to Node.js specifically?
