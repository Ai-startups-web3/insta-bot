Day 2 of Reactjs For advanced Developers Journey!

Yesterday, our deep dive into React's core mental model truly clarified the 'why' behind its declarative nature. It wasn't about new syntax, but rather a profound exploration of how React *thinks* about UI updates and state changes.

Understanding the reconciliation process as the very foundation of React's predictable behavior, beyond just its performance benefits, felt like a significant upgrade to my intuition. It's a powerful reminder that sometimes, the most advanced learning comes from deeply understanding the fundamentals, even for experienced developers.

Has anyone else found a similar experience revisiting core concepts later in their journey, uncovering new layers of understanding?
