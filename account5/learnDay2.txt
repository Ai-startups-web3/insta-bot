Day 2 of AR/VR in Education: Transforming Learning Journey! ✨ Building on yesterday's insights, today truly solidified the distinct power of Augmented Reality versus Virtual Reality in pedagogical contexts. It’s more than just a technological difference; it's about understanding *when* to use each to maximize learning impact.

I'm realizing that AR excels at enriching our immediate environment – imagine anatomy overlays on a science lab or interactive historical timelines integrated into a classroom. VR, on the other hand, transports learners completely, ideal for exploring distant planets, intricate machinery, or historical events as if they were there. This clarity helps immensely when considering those "small, tangible steps" educators can take. It’s about matching the right immersive tool to the learning objective.

What are some of the most compelling, practical examples you've seen where AR or VR was perfectly applied to a specific learning outcome?
