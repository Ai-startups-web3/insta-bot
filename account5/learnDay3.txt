Day 3 of AR/VR in Education: Transforming Learning Journey! ✨ Reflecting on yesterday's deep dive, a crucial realization for me has been the nuanced power each immersive technology brings. It's not about which is 'better,' but understanding their distinct pedagogical strengths.

AR truly shines when you want to augment the learner’s existing reality, like overlaying anatomical structures in a biology lab or bringing historical figures to life right in the classroom. Conversely, VR excels at full immersion, transporting students to ancient civilizations or distant galaxies for deeply experiential learning.

This clarity helps immensely in identifying where educators can take those 'small, tangible steps.' It really boils down to matching the immersive tool precisely to the learning objective. What are some of the most compelling, practical examples you've encountered where AR or VR was perfectly applied to a specific learning outcome?
